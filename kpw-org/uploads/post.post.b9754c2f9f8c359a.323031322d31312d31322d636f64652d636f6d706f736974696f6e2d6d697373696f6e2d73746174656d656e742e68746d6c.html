<h1>"What is this blog about?"</h1>

<p>
This blog is dedicated to writing code (more importantly - <em>good code</em>). To help encourage the composition of <em>good code</em>, I intend to comment and discuss (and attempt to illuminate) ways to make code better, and hopefully help other people - you - as well as myself, write, understand and practice good code.

There are a couple things that have stuck in mind from my short time coding and my longer time writing. The first and foremost feature of writing better - code and everything else - is to <u>read a lot</u>.

Read as much as you can.

I think this applies just the same to coding/programming as well as writing. The more code you read and interact with, the better you will become at writing it yourself. Coders are the tinkering type but sometimes we lack the patience to follow through on slow and monotonous tasks such as reading through long dry code. But this is what makes you better and thus for that reason, I will post snippets of code, not too much and mostly my own code, in order to help whoever out there needs more insight on coding.
